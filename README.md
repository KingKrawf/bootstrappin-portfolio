# bootstrappin-portfolio

Through this week of finishing our introduction to HTML we have gotten to work with multiple functions. In this assignment we were to create a portfolio using 3 different pages. 

## About Me 
In the about me we were to create a navbar, image and pargraph near the image using rows and columns. 

## Contact 
In the contact page we were to create a similar navbar to the about me page and create a slot for the users Name, Email along with a message that can be attached. 

## Gallery
In the gallery we were to create a similar navbar to the others, along with creating a portfolio of images that were stacked in rows and in columns. Two on top, Two in the middle and One on the bottom while all being centered.
